              <p>
                I'm a developer resident in Port Harcourt Nigeria, with 2+ years
                of experience in deploying and maintaining digital products. I
                work mainly with the MERN Stack and other modern technologies in
                the Javascript Ecosystem.
              </p>

              <p>
                As a user-centric developer, I like to be fully involved with
                the development process of building products that solve users
                problems and meets stakeholders requirements. Using my big head
                and a wide variety of industry standards, best practices and
                methodologies, I am able to carry out research for user needs,
                data flow and features, conceptualize actual solutions and test
                them with final end-users.
              </p>

              <p>
                I currently work as a freelance developer, also designed
                interfaces for small companies & startups. I also teach newbies,
                developers, how to code at devsfastlane.
              </p>

              <p>
                I write too! My thoughts and writings go up on Medium and you
                can also find articles I have written right here. Currently, I'm
                learning more advanced topics like systems design, algorithms &
                data structures to help season my skills. I have an obsession
                for chicken pepper soup and enjoy workout to stay healthy. You
                can almost always find me listening to music or watching some
                good content on YouTube.
